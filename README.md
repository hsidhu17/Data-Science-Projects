# Data-Science-Projects
A collection of sample data science projects 


1. end-to-end-heart-disease-classification

  One of the projects I completed as a part of Udemy's "Completing Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery" course. An end-to-end workflow from data exploration, feature engineering, data visualization, and model evaluation. Focused primarily on classication models. 

2. end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression

  One of the projects I completed as a part of Udemy's "Completing Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery" course. Built upon skills learned in the heart disease project, such as data analysis, and feature engineering. Focused primarily on regression models and different respective evaluation metrics. 

3. dog_vision

  The last project I completed as a part of Udemy's "Completing Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery" course. My first exposure to unsupervised learning in data science! Learned several new skills such as transfer learning, neural networks, TensorFlow and PyTorch. 

4. Titanic Survival

  My first independent project outside of the Udemy course. Focused on analyzed a dataset on titantic passengers, using classification models to determine which passengers survived. Exposed to several new data exploration techniques, such as a more in-depth understanding of the seaborn package. Also learned new feature engineering techniques, such as how to mputate missing values. Built on skills learned in the course to optimize and evaluate model. 

5. House Prices Regression

  My second independent project - this time focusing on regression models. I analyzed a dataset on house prices in Iowa to determine Sale Prices of a test set. Learned new data exploration techniques to understand the data at a deeper level and see correlation between variables. Also was exposed to skewed variables and outliers and effective means to resolve such issues. Built on skills learned in the course to optimize and evaluate the model.
